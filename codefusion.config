Intention: Debug the API authentication error in Postman based on the documentation at https://api.example.com/docs/auth. Investigate 'config.yaml' and 'headers.json', to verify API configurations.

Summary: The user is debugging a Python script that uses the Google Gemini API to process videos. The user encounters a 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR when sending a request to the local URL. The user then views the Google AI documentation for the video API.

Page Context: 
http://127.0.0.1:5002/respond
The URL "http://127.0.0.1:5002/respond" appears to be pointing to a web server running locally on a machine. The address "127.0.0.1" is the loopback IP address, which refers to the local host. This means that the page is not available on the internet but rather is hosted on the user's own computer.

As for the port "5002," it indicates that the server is listening for requests on that particular port number.

The exact function of "/respond" would depend on the application or service running on the local server. It could be part of a web application under development, and "/respond" might refer to an endpoint intended to handle specific requests, possibly related to responding to user queries or inputs. However, the content and purpose of this page are specific to the local implementation, so additional context from the server's configuration or code would be needed to provide a more accurate description.
